# AVL-Tree in C++
This GitHub repository contains a C++ implementation of an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. The implementation includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching, as well as functions to maintain the balance of the tree. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a useful resource for anyone looking to learn about AVL trees or implement one in their own project.


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

To use this implementation, clone the repository and use the makefile to generate an executable called testapp. Once the executable is generated, you can run testapp to test the implementation.

git clone https://github.com/charlijj/AVL-Tree </br>
cd AVL-tree-cpp </br>
make </br>
./testapp </br>

or ./testapp < input.500 to test results of a tree with 500 nodes

<h2>Usage</h2>
  
The testapp program allows you to test the basic operations of the AVL tree, including insertion, deletion, and searching. The program will prompt you for input and display the results of each operation. There are also addtional operations that allow the user test manual rotations. 

<h2>Note</h2>
  
This program is for demonstration and testing purposes only. It is not production ready.
